# Zuber-Database-Analysis
## Introduction
You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.
Working with a database, you'll analyze data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency. 
## Description of the data 
A database with info on taxi rides in Chicago:  

**neighborhoods table**: data on city neighborhoods  
- name: name of the neighborhood  
- neighborhood_id: neighborhood code  

**cabs table**: data on taxis   
- cab_id: vehicle code  
- vehicle_id: the vehicle's technical ID  
- company_name: the company that owns the vehicle  

**trips table**: data on rides  
- trip_id: ride code  
- cab_id: code of the vehicle operating the ride  
- start_ts: date and time of the beginning of the ride (time rounded to the hour)  
- end_ts: date and time of the end of the ride (time rounded to the hour)  
- duration_seconds: ride duration in seconds  
- distance_miles: ride distance in miles  
- pickup_location_id: pickup neighborhood code  
- dropoff_location_id: dropoff neighborhood code   

**weather_records table**: data on weather  
- record_id: weather record code  
- ts: record date and time (time rounded to the hour)  
- temperature: temperature when the record was taken  
- description: brief description of weather conditions, e.g. "light rain" or "scattered clouds"

## Project Analysis
### Exploratory data analysis
1. Find the number of taxi rides for each taxi company for November 15-16, 2017. Name the resulting field trips_amount and print it along with the company_name field. Sort the results by the trips_amount field in descending order.
2. Find the number of rides for every taxi company whose name contains the words "Yellow" or "Blue" for November 1-7, 2017. Name the resulting variable trips_amount. Group the results by the company_name field.
3. In November 2017, the most popular taxi companies were Flash Cab and Taxi Affiliation Services. Find the number of rides for these two companies and name the resulting variable trips_amount. Join the rides for all other companies in the group "Other." Group the data by taxi company names. Name the field with taxi company names company. Sort the result in descending order by trips_amount.
### Determine if and how the duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays compared to other days of the week and other weather conditions.
1. Retrieve the identifiers of the O'Hare and Loop neighborhoods from the neighborhoods table.
2. For each hour, retrieve the weather condition records from the weather_records table. Using the CASE operator, break all hours into two groups: "Bad" if the description field contains the words "rain" or "storm," and "Good" for others. Name the resulting field weather_conditions. The final table must include two fields: date and hour (ts) and weather_conditions.
3. Retrieve from the trips table all the rides that started in the Loop (neighborhood_id: 50) and ended at O'Hare (neighborhood_id: 63) on a Saturday. Get the weather conditions for each ride. Use the method you applied in the previous task. Also retrieve the duration of each ride. Ignore rides for which data on weather conditions is not available.

## Project Insight
### Conclusion
1. The five enterprises with the most considerable number of trips are (descending order): Flash Cab, Taxi Affiliation Services, Medallion Leasing, Yellow Cab, and Taxi Affiliation Service Yellow
2. There is a discrepancy in the average trip duration from the Loop to Oâ€™Hare International Airport on rainy Saturdays, as it is longer on bad weather conditions, which suggest that weather conditions may play a notable role in influencing ride durations.  
### Suggestions for Further Improvement or Business Outcomes 
1. **Enhance Service Allocation:**  
    - Allocate resources strategically by recognizing the popularity of Flash Cab, Taxi Affiliation Services, Medallion Leasing, Yellow Cab, and Taxi Affiliation Service Yellow. Consider optimizing fleet distribution based on demand patterns for these key players.  
2. **Weather-Responsive Pricing Models:**  
    - Implement dynamic pricing models that consider weather conditions, offering incentives during inclement weather to encourage more ridership. This could involve discounts during rainy Saturdays to attract passengers during adverse conditions.  
3. **Route Optimization:**  
    - Optimize routes or provide alternative routes during bad weather conditions, especially for routes like the Loop to O'Hare International Airport, where longer trip durations are observed. This can improve overall customer satisfaction and potentially reduce operational costs.  
4. **User-Friendly Weather Notifications:**  
    - Implement a feature within the app to notify users about potential weather-related impacts on ride durations, allowing for informed decisions and better user experience.
5. **Continuous Data Analysis and Adaptation:**
    - Establish a continuous analysis process to monitor changing trends in customer preferences and external factors. This ongoing assessment will enable the company to adapt quickly to evolving market dynamics and stay ahead of competitors.
6. **Customer Feedback Mechanism:**
    - Implement a feedback mechanism to gather customer opinions specifically related to weather conditions, allowing the company to fine-tune services based on real-time user experiences and expectations during different weather scenarios.
7. **Collaborations with Top-Performing Companies:**  
    - Explore partnerships or collaborations with the top-performing taxi companies to strengthen the company's market position and potentially offer joint promotions or services to a broader customer base.
